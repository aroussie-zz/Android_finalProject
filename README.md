# Android_finalProject
This is the final project of my Android class. The purpose of my application, called “My media Library”, is to allow the user to gather in one application, all the media he had access to. That means be able with one application to manage his movie library but also his TV show library and his book library.

I'm still working on this project to make it really interesting. For the moment I have only worked on the "Movie" part of the application. Here is what it is possible to do for now:
- You can search a new movie via his title
- You can add a movie you find via the search
- You can see all the information about a movie of your library
- You can do some updates like mark your movie as “seen” or “favorite”
- You can remove a movie from your library
- You can receive daily notifications suggesting to watch a movie you haven’t yet

In this project I'm using a SQLite database, and I'm also using the API of www.betaseries.com to retrieve information about the movies.

As I said I'm currently working on this project to be able to use my application for TV shows and books as well.
You can find some pictures of my application into the "Snapshots" folder.
